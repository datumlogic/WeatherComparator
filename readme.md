This project goes along with the following blog post:

The intent is to demonstrate how to use private libraries with Cocoapods.

After installing cocoapods (see <http://www.cocoapods.org> for instructions), clone this project and execute <code>pod install</code> at the root of the project directory.  This will download and configure the dependent projects (<https://github.com/stevenpsmith/YahooWeatherService> and <https://github.com/stevenpsmith/WunderWeatherService>) to work with this project.  It is a very contrived example, but it demonstrates how to use cocoapods with various libraries.  Again, see the associated blog post for a details description on how to use cocoapods with private libraries.
